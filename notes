Omniauth setup for facebook

setup gemfile
        gem 'omniauth'
        gem 'omniauth-facebook'
        gem 'dotenv-rails'
        #ADDED under group :development, :test do
                # Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using <%= console %> in views
                gem 'web-console', '~> 2.0'

Next, we'll need to tell OmniAuth about our app's OAuth credentials. Create a file named config/initializers/omniauth.rb. It will contain the following lines:

            Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
              provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']
            end

      Log in to the Facebook developer site. In the My Apps dropdown menu at the top-right of the page, select Add a New App, and a modal should appear. Fill out the requested information and click Create App ID. You should now be on the Product Setup page — if you are not, look in the sidebar for + Add Product under the Products heading. On the Product Setup page, click Get Started next to Facebook Login:

        Facebook Login

      Choose the Web option, and enter http://localhost:3000/ when it prompts you for your Site URL. Click Save, and then click on Settings under the Facebook Login heading in the sidebar:

        Facebook Login Settings

      In the Valid OAuth redirect URIs field, enter localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback, which is the default callback endpoint for the omniauth-facebook strategy:

        Valid OAuth redirect URIs

      Click Save Changes, and then click on Dashboard in the sidebar. Keep the page handy because we'll need those App ID and App Secret values in a minute, but first...

Add dotenv-rails to your Gemfile and bundle install.
Create a file named .env at the root of your application (in this case, inside the omniauth_readme/ directory).
Add your Facebook app credentials to the newly created .env file
Add .env to your .gitignore file to ensure that you don't accidentally commit your precious credentials.
For step three, take the App ID and App Secret values from the Facebook app dashboard... Facebook App Dashboard

...and paste them into the .env file as follows:

FACEBOOK_KEY=247632982388118
FACEBOOK_SECRET=01ab234567890c123d456ef78babc901

To handle user sessions, we need to create a single route, sessions#create, which is where Facebook will redirect users in the callback phase of the login process. Add the following to config/routes.rb:

      get '/auth/facebook/callback' => 'sessions#create'
